Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering entails the appkication of engineering principles and methods to the development of high quality software. Software engineering plays a vital role in the technology industry because it enables the creation of software solutions that powers many aspect of modern life.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
- development of programming languages like Fortran, C
- establishment of software ebgineering as a discipline in 1960
- rise of agile methodologies in the 2000

The creation of programming languages like c served as a framework upon which many high-level programming languages are built e.g python.
The establishment of the software engineering as a discipline in the 1960 enables rapid development of the field
The rise of agile methodologies in the 2000 enables the creation of a developmental framework that allows for iterative development and deployment. 


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
- Requirements
- Design
- Implementation
- Testing
- Deployment
- Maintenance

Requirement entails gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements
Design involves crafting software architecture and user interfaces
Implementation involves building the software based on the requirements and design
Testing involves conducting various test to ensure softwware meets quality standard, user and functional requirements
Deployment involves hosting software application on a server to enable accessibility to users
Maintenance involves providing continuous support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.



Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall involves sequential approach with distinct phases (e.g., requirements, design, implementation) while Agile methodology focuses on iterative and incremental approach and responding to change.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
